shoes_app
=========

This is final application for shoes eshop, Kansei Engineering is used in this implementation. 

Demo can be found here: http://ropeko.sk/shoes_app/www/.

Kansei application is based on emotional perception of objects. Objects - shoes have atributes like heel, prefered season to wear, color, price. These shoes atributes can be found on a web page of shoes https://buffalo-shop.de/. Emotional atributes are comfort (comfortable...uncomfortable), color (bright...dark), weather (cold...warm) and price (cheap..expensive). Emotional atributes are mapped by functions to real atributes and it is found best match which is shown on a picture. Possible errors are caused by small database of shoes.

This application is written in Php (Nette framework http://nette.org/ ) and real atributes are stored in Mysql database.
